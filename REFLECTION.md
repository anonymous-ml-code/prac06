# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I’ve started breaking down larger problems into smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach has helped me understand complex concepts better and prevented me from feeling overwhelmed. I’ve also been more proactive in seeking help when I don’t understand something, rather than waiting until it becomes a bigger issue.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management and avoid procrastination. Sometimes I leave tasks to the last minute, which leads to unnecessary stress. I also need to engage more actively with the course material, especially by doing extra practice and testing concepts outside of class.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’m doing well at keeping up with the weekly exercises and completing my assignments on time. I’ve also been consistent in reviewing lecture notes after class, which helps reinforce what I’ve learned.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop overcomplicating problems. Sometimes I overthink simple tasks, trying to find the "perfect" solution, when a more straightforward approach would work just as well. I also need to stop relying too much on solutions from others and focus more on understanding the problem-solving process myself.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

It would be helpful if there were more interactive activities or discussions to encourage engagement with the material. More opportunities for collaborative learning would allow us to tackle more complex problems and get feedback from peers and instructors in real time.
